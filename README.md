# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction
### Machine Learning Project for Early Diabetes Detection

**Diabetes Prediction** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have **diabetes** based on several medical and lifestyle features.  
The project uses **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and supervised machine learning models** to perform binary classification.

This project is implemented using **Python** and presented in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe health complications if not detected early.  
Early prediction helps in prevention, lifestyle management, and timely medical intervention.

The goal of this project is to:
- Apply machine learning techniques in healthcare
- Analyze medical datasets effectively
- Build predictive models to assist early diagnosis
